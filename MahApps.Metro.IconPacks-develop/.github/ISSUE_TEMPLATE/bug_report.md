**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

Note: There is also a [gitter room](https://gitter.im/MahApps/MahApps.Metro.IconPacks) to ask about usage or something else.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Go to '...'
2. Click on '....'
3. Scroll down to '....'
4. See error

**Expected behavior**
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.

**Screenshots**
If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.

**Desktop Environment (please complete the following information):**
 - IconPacks Version: [e.g. v2.3.0]
 - Visual Studio: [e.g. 2019 16.x.x]
 - .NET Framework: [e.g. 4.7.2]

**Repo**
If it's possible follow these guidelines for a good sample and I will most likely look at the issue sooner:

  - Post a full (small) GitHub repository. Not a zip file, half baked snippet etc. If GitHub is new to you consider it a great learning opportunity and chance to get involved.
  - The repository should have just ONE step max for me to get running, and that is "Restore NuGet Packages". If there are any other missing dependencies, or uncompiling features I will most likely move on to another issue.
  - I'm not trying to be awkward. I'm just busy and I'm helping a lot of people, not just you, so help me out and I will help you out.
